Pagination is a series of interconnected pages with similar material. 
It's worth noting that we'll still refer to pagination when the material on a page segment is split into several pages.

Pagination in React JS is especially useful for huge datasets, such as maps or visualizations, 
where the number of elements presented may exceed the space provided on a single page. Pagination, 
in this example, aids users in navigating enormous datasets by allowing them to hop without having to 
navigate from one webpage to the next and reload each time they want to view anything new.



Basic Pagination Example
Basic pagination is a quick and straightforward technique to present text in an ordered, 
readable style. This strategy comes in handy when you have many things to display, such as in a table or displaying search results.

<Pagination count={10} />

<Pagination count={10} color="primary" />

<Pagination count={10} color="secondary" />

<Pagination count={10} disabled />



Outlined Pagination
Pagination with outlines is a pagination in which brief remarks or outlines follow page numbers. 
These outlines can include information such as the page's topic content or a brief synopsis.

This Pagination in React JS pattern is commonly found in reference volumes and other works requiring extensive explanations and analysis. 
The outlines help readers scan the book for certain topics without reading all the pages to locate them.

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" />

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" color="primary" />




Rounded Pagination
Rounded pagination is a method of organizing material such that the next or previous page may be quickly found. 
Instead of using serial numbers, rounded numbers are used in this pagination type. After each number in the list, 
the number of pages will be presented in dots, making it easier for users to browse the site.

There are various advantages to using rounded Pagination in React JS. It makes your site more user-friendly by clarifying 
how many pages are available and how far they have progressed. Second, it can assist you in determining how much material 
is displayed at any one time.

<Pagination count={10} shape="rounded" />

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" shape="rounded" />



<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" color="secondary" />

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" disabled />





Pagination Size
The number of posts per page is called the pagination size. Most blogs include this. 
The number of posts per page is called the pagination size. Most blogs include this feature,
which you may change to suit your needs.

It's crucial to remember that this setting has no bearing on the overall number of posts displayed on your blog; 
it simply impacts how many are displayed at any given time. If your blog has ten posts and the pagination size is set to 5, 
you'll view five at a time, but if you click "next," you'll see another five entries.

<Pagination count={10} size="small" />

<Pagination count={10} />

<Pagination count={10} size="large" />






Buttons
The pagination buttons are the most significant aspect of the user interface. It enables users to browse between pages and move ahead and backward. The buttons should be easy to identify and utilize so that users can navigate through the material without effort. Buttons are an important aspect of Pagination in React JS, although they aren't usually utilized correctly. 

<Pagination count={10} showFirstButton showLastButton />

<Pagination count={10} hidePrevButton hideNextButton />

Here are some principles for creating clear and easy-to-use pagination buttons:

Make the buttons large and distinct from the text. Because they're the sole means for your users to move around information, 
you want them to be as big and obvious as possible.

Make sure your buttons clearly state what will happen when they are clicked; otherwise, people may become confused and quit your site. 
On a pagination page with "Next," "Previous," and "First" buttons, for example, ensure the "First" button isn't named "Prev," or vice versa!

Make sure your buttons are responsive: they should function properly regardless of how they are viewed 
(and many people will be viewing them on smaller devices).
