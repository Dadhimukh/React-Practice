Pagination is a series of interconnected pages with similar material. 
It's worth noting that we'll still refer to pagination when the material on a page segment is split into several pages.

Pagination in React JS is especially useful for huge datasets, such as maps or visualizations, 
where the number of elements presented may exceed the space provided on a single page. Pagination, 
in this example, aids users in navigating enormous datasets by allowing them to hop without having to 
navigate from one webpage to the next and reload each time they want to view anything new.



Basic Pagination Example
Basic pagination is a quick and straightforward technique to present text in an ordered, 
readable style. This strategy comes in handy when you have many things to display, such as in a table or displaying search results.

<Pagination count={10} />

<Pagination count={10} color="primary" />

<Pagination count={10} color="secondary" />

<Pagination count={10} disabled />



Outlined Pagination
Pagination with outlines is a pagination in which brief remarks or outlines follow page numbers. 
These outlines can include information such as the page's topic content or a brief synopsis.

This Pagination in React JS pattern is commonly found in reference volumes and other works requiring extensive explanations and analysis. 
The outlines help readers scan the book for certain topics without reading all the pages to locate them.

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" />

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" color="primary" />




Rounded Pagination
Rounded pagination is a method of organizing material such that the next or previous page may be quickly found. 
Instead of using serial numbers, rounded numbers are used in this pagination type. After each number in the list, 
the number of pages will be presented in dots, making it easier for users to browse the site.

There are various advantages to using rounded Pagination in React JS. It makes your site more user-friendly by clarifying 
how many pages are available and how far they have progressed. Second, it can assist you in determining how much material 
is displayed at any one time.

<Pagination count={10} shape="rounded" />

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" shape="rounded" />



<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" color="secondary" />

<Pagination count={10} variant="outlined" disabled />
