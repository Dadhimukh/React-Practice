Pagination is a series of interconnected pages with similar material. 
It's worth noting that we'll still refer to pagination when the material on a page segment is split into several pages.

Pagination in React JS is especially useful for huge datasets, such as maps or visualizations, 
where the number of elements presented may exceed the space provided on a single page. Pagination, 
in this example, aids users in navigating enormous datasets by allowing them to hop without having to 
navigate from one webpage to the next and reload each time they want to view anything new.



Basic Pagination Example
Basic pagination is a quick and straightforward technique to present text in an ordered, 
readable style. This strategy comes in handy when you have many things to display, such as in a table or displaying search results.

<Pagination count={10} />

<Pagination count={10} color="primary" />

<Pagination count={10} color="secondary" />

<Pagination count={10} disabled />
