Props stand for "Properties" in React. They are read-only inputs to components. Props are an object 
which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. 
It gives a way to pass data from the parent to the child components throughout the application.

It is similar to function arguments and passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.

Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. 
These attributes are available in the component as this.props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method.
