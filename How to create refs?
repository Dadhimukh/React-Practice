Refs can be created by using React.createRef() and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. 
It is commonly assigned to an instance property when a component is created, and then can be referenced throughout the component.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {  
  constructor(props) {  
    super(props);  
    this.callRef = React.createRef();  
  }  
  render() {  
    return <div ref={this.callRef} />;  
  }  
}
