The functionalities and features of Hooks are similar to Javascript functions. 
However, before using them, you need to keep specific rules in mind, as these rules 
ensure that all the stateful logic in a functional component is visible in its source code. 

Rule 1: Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
Hooks aren't supposed to be called from loops, conditions, or nested functions. 
Hooks should always be utilized at the top level of React methods. 
This rule ensures that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.

Rule 2: Only Call Hooks from React Functions
Hooks can't be called from JavaScript functions. Hooks can be called from React 
function components instead. Custom Hooks can also be used to call Hooks.
