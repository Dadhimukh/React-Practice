A synthetic event is an object which acts as a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. 
It combines the behavior of different browser's native event into one API, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault().

In the given example, e is a Synthetic event.

function ActionLink() {  
    function handleClick(e) {  
        e.preventDefault();  
        console.log('You had clicked a Link.');  
    }  
    return (  
        <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>  
              Click_Me  
        </a>  
    );  
}
