Conditional rendering refers to the dynamic output of user interface markups based on a condition state. 
It works in the same way as JavaScript conditions. Using conditional rendering, it is possible to toggle specific application functions, 
API data rendering, hide or show elements, decide permission levels, authentication handling, and so on.

There are different approaches for implementing conditional rendering in React. Some of them are:

Using if-else conditional logic which is suitable for smaller as well as for medium-sized applications
Using ternary operators, which takes away some amount of complication from if-else statements
Using element variables, which will enable us to write cleaner code.
