The Arrow function is the new feature of the ES6 standard. 
If you need to use arrow functions, it is not necessary to bind any event to 'this.' 
Here, the scope of 'this' is global and not limited to any calling function. So If you are using Arrow Function, 
there is no need to bind 'this' inside the constructor. It is also called 'fat arrow '(=>) functions.



//General way  
render() {      
    return(  
        <MyInput onChange={this.handleChange.bind(this) } />  
    );  
}  


//With Arrow Function  
render() {    
    return(  
        <MyInput onChange={ (e) => this.handleOnChange(e) } />  
    );  
}
