We can implement routing in our React application using this method:

Considering we have the components App, About, and Contact in our application:


const routing = (
                  <Router>
                    <div>
                        <h1>React Router Example</h1>
                        <Route path="/" component={App}/>
                        <Route path="/about" component={About}/>
                        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact}/>
                    </div>
                </Router>
              );
