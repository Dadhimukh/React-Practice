what is react ?
                React is a javascript liberary, which is used to create UI (UserInterface) Components.


What is babel ?
                Bable is a javascript compiler that can translate markup or programming language into javascript.
                
==========> React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.


What is JSX?
              JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

              JSX is an XML/HTML like extension to JavaScript.
              
              
What is the use of React DOM Render method
                         The method ReactDom.render() is used to render (display) HTML elements
                 
                 
                 
                 
                 
JSX Expressions
                Expressions can be used in JSX by wrapping them in curly {} braces
                
                
                
                
                
                
React Elements
                React applications are usually built around a single HTML element.
                React developers often call this the root node
                
                Elements are rendered (displayed) with the ReactDOM.render() method
                
                React elements are immutable. They cannot be changed.
  
                The only way to change a React element is to render a new element every time
                
                
                
                
                
                
Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.
                                                Real DOM: The Real DOM represents the actual HTML structure of a web page. 
                                                It is a tree-like structure that consists of nodes representing HTML elements, attributes, and text content.
                                                Virtual DOM: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or abstraction of the Real DOM. It is a JavaScript representation of the UI, 
                                                maintained in memory. It is not directly rendered on the screen but acts as a blueprint of the Real DOM.
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                
Component-based architecture:
                              React allows developers to split her UI into reusable components. 
                              Each component maintains its own state and can be assembled to create complex user interfaces. 
                              This modular approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and isolation of code concerns. 
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                
Virtual DOM:  
              Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight duplicate of the actual HTML DOM.
              The Virtual DOM enables React to effectively update and render UI components while making little changes to the real DOM. 
              This optimisation improves speed and creates a more pleasant user experience.
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
JSX syntax: 
            React utilizes JSX (JavaScript XML), an extension to JavaScript, to define the structure and appearance of components. 
            JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which is then transpiled into regular JavaScript during the build process. 
            This combination of JavaScript and HTML makes component creation and composition more intuitive and readable.
            
            
            
            
            
            
           
Unidirectional data flow: 
                          React uses unidirectional data flow, commonly known as one-way binding.
                          Props (properties) provide data from the parent component to the child component, 
                          and callbacks allow the child component to communicate with the parent component. 
                          This approach streamlines data management and reduces the potential for unintended side effects.  










React Hooks:  
              React Hooks allow you to access state and other React capabilities in functional components.
              This allows developers to handle stateful logic without creating class components, 
              making it easier to reuse code and share stateful logic between components. 
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
Rich ecosystem and community: 
                              React offers a large ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support. 
                              This contains well-known frameworks such as React Router for routing, Redux for state management, 
                              and Axios for processing HTTP requests. The vibrant React community adds a variety of learning tools, 
                              tutorials, and reusable components.
