Web browsers can't read JSX directly. This is because the web browsers are built to read the regular JS objects only, 
and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object. 

If you want a web browser to read a JSX file, you must transform the files into a regular JavaScript object. 
For this purpose, Babel is used.
