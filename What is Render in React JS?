The virtual DOM comprises the specific node tree, which has its elements and attributes with its properties and objects. Using the render() function,
we can create a node using it is in-built react components and can do the modification of the node as per the action method in the data model. 
It is a light JavaScript object and can be consumed easily in different applications as per certain project requirements.

in the code logic.
