The state is a built-in React object that contains data or information about the component. 
A componentâ€™s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in state can 
happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the component's behavior and how it will render.  



class Greetings extends React.Component {

  state = {

    name: "World"

  };

  updateName() {

    this.setState({ name: "Simplilearn" });

  }

  render() {

      return(

          <div>

              {this.state.name}

          </div>

      )

  }

}
