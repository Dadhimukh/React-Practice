The state is a built-in React object that contains data or information about the component. 
A componentâ€™s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in state can 
happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the component's behavior and how it will render.  



class Greetings extends React.Component {

  state = {

    name: "World"

  };

  updateName() {

    this.setState({ name: "Simplilearn" });

  }

  render() {

      return(

          <div>

              {this.state.name}

          </div>

      )

  }

}




A state can be modified based on user action or network changes
Every time the state of an object changes, React re-renders the component to the browser
The state object is initialized in the constructor
The state object can store multiple properties
this.setState() is used to change the value of the state object
setState() function performs a shallow merge between the new and the previous state
